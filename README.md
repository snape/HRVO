The Hybrid Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle
=======================================

<https://gamma.cs.unc.edu/HRVO/>

We present the hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle (HRVO) for collision-free and
oscillation-free navigation of multiple mobile robots or virtual agents. Each
robot senses its surroundings and acts independently without central
coordination or communication with other robots. Our approach uses both the
current position and the velocity of other robots to compute their future
trajectories in order to avoid collisions. Moreover, our approach is reciprocal
and avoids oscillations by explicitly taking into account that the other robots
also sense their surroundings and change their trajectories accordingly. We
apply hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacles to iRobot Create mobile robots and
demonstrate direct, collision-free, and oscillation-free navigation.
