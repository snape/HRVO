  We present the hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle (HRVO) for collision-free
  and oscillation-free navigation of multiple mobile robots or virtual agents.
  Each robot senses its surroundings and acts independently without central
  coordination or communication with other robots. Our approach uses both the
  current position and the velocity of other robots to compute their future
  trajectories in order to avoid collisions. Moreover, our approach is
  reciprocal and avoids oscillations by explicitly taking into account that the
  other robots also sense their surroundings and change their trajectories
  accordingly. We apply hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacles to iRobot Create
  mobile robots and demonstrate direct, collision-free, and oscillation-free
  navigation.
