 * @details    We present the hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle for
 *             collision-free and oscillation-free navigation of multiple mobile
 *             robots or virtual agents. Each robot or virtual agents senses its
 *             surroundings and acts independently without central coordination
 *             or communication with other robots or virtual agents. Our
 *             approach uses both the current position and the velocity of other
 *             robots or virtual agents to compute their future trajectories in
 *             order to avoid collisions. Moreover, our approach is reciprocal
 *             and avoids oscillations by explicitly taking into account that
 *             the other robots or virtual agents also sense their surroundings
 *             and change their trajectories accordingly.
